> ðŸš¨ **Alert** This is a study project, i'm using it to build my games/tools but its not intended to be a working product for use (yet!), so use it with _caution_ and don't expect things to work properly out of the box.

### How to enter the fortress?

Just click the use this template button in the github page to quickly clone the framework for your own repo. The framework works best with a combo of visual studio code + [commandbar extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gsppvo.vscode-commandbar) with custom commands to setup and build the project.

This is what the architecture looks like:

```
â””â”€â”€ root
    â””â”€â”€ .build
        â”œâ”€â”€ res
        â”œâ”€â”€ game_debug.exe
        â”œâ”€â”€ dlls
    â””â”€â”€ .release
        â”œâ”€â”€ res
        â”œâ”€â”€ game.exe
        â”œâ”€â”€ dlls
    â””â”€â”€ res
    â””â”€â”€ src
```

You can look at the [Twitter gif maker](https://github.com/bigasdev/Twitter-Gif-Maker) source code for a exampe of a complete application created with the framework.
